  <p>China is very against copyright they have this thing called IPR and its been helping increase the rate of no copyright for the past 5 years. And not to menetion the people of China probably wouldnt do copyright because people are scard of the governemnt. If you do copyright you can become in big trouble and possible to go to jail. But all this copyright laws werent always here they really didnt start till 1990s. </p>
